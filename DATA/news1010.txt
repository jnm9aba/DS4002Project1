It’s so strange to think she’s been queen so long that people have been born, lived, had kids and grandkids, and died all during her reign
It's my grandmother's 100th birthday tomorrow, she got her telegram/letter/whatever it is from the Queen this morning.
Imagine your first Prime Minister being Winston Churchill and your last Prime Minister being Liz Truss.
She’s been a permanent fixture of the UK for so long. It’s crazy to think that the “old guard” is almost gone (Gorbachev too)
This is one of those things you know is coming but you just never think it'll happen. A constant in most peoples life for the past 70 years.
RIP. It actually happened.
She most likely passed when all the family members were called.
*Liz Truss sweats profusely*
She was born before Martin Luther King Jr. and Anne Frank...
"King of England" doesn't sound right at this point
Glad it's over, imagine being a juror and spending that much time, making $30 a day to deal with this shit.
Honestly quite surprised, considering the usual US standards for defamation being fairly high.
“Tell the world Johnny, see what a Judge or Jury thinks. Tell the world, I Johnny Depp, a man, am a victim too of domestic violence.  See how many people believe or side with you.” - Amber Heard.And he did. He told the world, and won.
Wow they are ruling for Depp on every count. I'm surprised.
Not sure that Aquaman 2 salary is going to cover this tsunami....
She’ll pledge to pay the damages.
"No one will believe you, Johnny."
I hope Johnny donates 7 million of this settlement to the LA Children's Hospital as a final fuck you.
Amber Heard's career was already tarnished by the public reception of this trial. This may be the last nail in the coffin to put an end to it.
Now she’s really going to shit the bed.
The comments in this thread are sorted by new due to the rapid developments occurring in Ukraine right now. You can view the comments sorted by best [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/t003vl/russia_declares_war_on_ukraine_reports_of/?sort=confidence)
Ukrainian President Zelensky's speech before the attack:"I have initiated a call today with the president of the Russian Federation. The result - silence. Although silence should be in Donbass.That is why today, I want to come with an appeal to all citizens of Russia. Not as President. I am appealing to the people of Russia as a citizen of Ukraine. We share more than two thousand kilometres of border. Around it, today, is your army: almost 200,000 soldiers; thousands of military units. Your leadership has approved their movement towards us. Towards the territory of another country. This step can become the start of a big war on the European continent. The whole world is talking about what can happen any day now. A reason can appear at any moment. Any provocation. Any spark. A spark that has the potential of burning everything down.You are told that this flame will bring freedom to the people of Ukraine. But the people of Ukraine are free. They remember their past, and are building their own future. They are building it, not destroying it, as you are told everyday on TV. Ukraine in your news and Ukraine in reality are two completely different countries. The most important difference is that ours is real.You are being told that we are nazis. But how can a nation be called nazist after sacrificing more than 8 million lives to eradicate nazism. How can I be a nazi, when my grandfather has survived the whole war as part of the Soviet infantry, and has died a colonel in an independent Ukraine. You are told that we hate Russian culture. But how can a culture be hated? Any culture. Neighbours are always enriching each other culturally. Yet, that does not make them one entity, and does not separate people into “us” and “them”. We are different, but that is not a reason to be enemies. We want to build our own history. Peacefully, calmly, and truthfully.You are told that I am ordering to attack the Donbass. To shoot. To bomb without questions. Although there are questions: To shoot at whom? To bomb what?Donetsk? To which I have been dozens of times. I have seen their faces and eyes.Artema street? On which I have been on many walks with my friends in the past.Donbass arena? Where I have been rooting with the locals for our boys during the Euros.Shcherbakova Park? In which we were drinking together after our team has lostLugansk? The home of my best friend’s mom. The place where my best friend’s father is buried.Note that I am now speaking in Russian, yet no one in Russia understands what these names, streets, and events mean. This is all foreign to you. Unknown. This is our land. This is our history. What are you going to fight for? And against whom?Many of you have visited Ukraine in the past. Many of you have relatives here. Some of you studied in our universities. Befriended Ukrainian people. You’re familiar with our character, with our people, our principles. You know what we cherish the most. Look inside you, listen to the voice of reason, of common sense. Hear our voices. The people of Ukraine want peace. Ukrainian authorities want peace. We want it, and we make it. We do everything in our powers. We are not alone. It’s true, Ukraine is supported by many countries. Why? Because we are not talking about peace at any cost. We are talking about peace, and about principles, justice. About everyone’s right to define their own future, of safety, and everyone’s right to live without threat. All this is important to us. All this is important for peace. I know for sure that this is also important for you. We know for sure that we don’t want war. Neither cold, hot, or hybrid.But, if we are threatened; If someone is trying to take away our country, our freedom, our lives. The lives of our children. We are going to defend ourselves. Not attack. Defend. By attacking us, you are going to see our faces. Not backs. Our faces.War is a big distress, and it has a big price - in all meanings of this word. People lose their money, reputation, quality of life, freedom, and most importantly, people lose their loved ones. Lose themselves. A lot of things are always lacking in war. But what is in abundance is pain, dirt, blood, and death. Thousands. Tens of thousands of deaths. You are told that Ukraine is a threat to Russia. This was not true before, not now, and won’t be in the future. You are demanding security assurances from NATO. We are also demanding assurances of our security. The security of Ukraine from you. From Russia. And from other signatories of the Budapest memorandum. Today, we are not part of random security alliances. The security of Ukraine is tied to the security of our neighbours. That is why we are now talking about the security of all Europe. But our main goal is peace in Ukraine, and the safety of our citizens. Of Ukrainians. We are determined to let everyone know about this, including you. War is going to deprive everyone of any assurances. No one will have assurances of security.Who is going to suffer from this the most? The people.Who does not want this more than anyone? The people.Who can prevent all this from happening? The people.If these people are among you. I am sure they are. Public figures, journalists, musicians, actors, athletes, scientists, doctors, bloggers, stand-up comics, tiktokers, and others. Ordinary people. Ordinary, simple people. Men, women, old, young, fathers, and most importantly - mothers. Just as much as the people in Ukraine, no matter how much they try to convince you of the opposite.I know that my announcement will not be aired on Russian television. But the citizens of Russia have to see it. They need to know the truth. And the truth is, that this needs to stop, before it’s too late. And if the authorities of Russia don’t want to talk to us, for the sake of peace, maybe they will talk to you.Do the people of Russia want war? I would’ve very much liked to be able to answer this, but the answer depends only on you - citizens of the Russian Federation."Credit to /u/nelyubov for the translation.
Putin has his boot on Ukraine’s neck and the whole time he keeps yelling “Ow, they’re hurting my ankle!”.
&gt;“A couple of words for those who would be tempted to intervene. Russia will respond immediately and you will have consequences that you never have had before in your history,” -PutinThat kinda sounds like a threat of nuclear action.
You mean the American intelligence that said this was going to happen was real all along, and the countries like Russia and China that insinuated it was just US hyperbole were full of shit?Shock!
Such a horrible day for Ukraine.
Sad day for humanity, there are no good outcomes. Just waste, distraction, destruction, and death.
Explosions were reported near Kyiv.... https://news.sky.com/story/explosions-reported-near-kyiv-after-putin-authorises-military-operation-in-ukraine-ukraine-latest-12541713
I’m just worried for all the Ukrainian citizens who aren’t able to get out. And for those who might lose everything.
Any American Official who supports Vladimir Putin is a goddamned Traitor.Any media person who backs praising Vladimir Putin is a goddamned Collaborator.
Calls to violence against any person, building, or institution is unacceptable. We will be issuing permanent bans to users who engage in such behavior.
The Director of the FBI—which is currently raiding Donald Trump’s home—was appointed by Donald Trump.

This feels different for some reason but I don't want to get hurt again.
Laughing at his misfortune aside, this is a **big fucking deal**. The FBI and judges are extremely aware of the optics of raiding a politician, especially if the person they are raiding turns out to be not guilty of a crime. To do that to a former president (and let's be honest, presumptive candidate) means they had some serious evidence to back up the search warrant.
[Trump](https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/1556775245981356034): "They even broke into my safe!"Bless his heart
It was a tremendous raid. Some people said it was the best raid they’d ever seen. Lots of people said that.
I like people who don't get raided
For the lazy, here's the full text of the article rn.&gt;The FBI executed a search warrant on Monday at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, the former President confirms to CNN.
You don't search the ex-President's house unless you KNOW you're gonna find something. What was in his safe? What's in the box?? What's in the box!?!
She died in her own home with all her independence and mental cognition, may we all be so lucky tbh

Thank you for making the world a little bit better Betty. You’ll be missed.
Betty takes a closing bow for 2021.
Betty White was an amazing woman. If you’ve never watched the Netflix documentary about her titled “Betty White: First Lady of Televsion,” I highly recommend it. Really makes you appreciate what a loving, compassionate woman she was and how much of an advocate she was for human rights and animals’ well-being.  Rest In Peace, Betty.
She just about did it all...**Reporter**: What have you not done in the business that you’ve always wanted to do?**Betty White**: Robert Redford
2021 with one last "Fuck you"
I'm reminded of a *Golden Girls* quote (mainly because on another forum someone had asked if Betty had been sick? What she die of?)Sophia:  \[enters kitchen, crying\] Esther Weinstock is dead. We grew up together. She was my best friend.    Dorothy:  Oh, I'm so sorry! What happened?    Sophia:  \[sarcastically\] She was fighting an oil-rig fire in the Gulf of Mexico. \[snapping\] **SHE WAS 88!**    Rose:  Well, it's great that she was able to work right up to the end.
She was the oldest of the four Golden Girls actresses, and she outlived the other three by ten years. RIP.
*Thank you for being a friend...*
I want to thank all of you, because I can’t just magically get a video trending in Russia. It needed to be shared and shared over and over again. There are still more people to reach, but if you shared this, you were part of this story. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Honestly it was an incredible speech. There are plenty of cringey celebrities moments where someone famous tries to make a tragic event about themselves, but this is not one of those times. Arnold really is a legend in every sense of the word.
That was so well said.
I liked the one he did for the Jan 6 insurrection. I saw a YouTuber inside Russia yesterday saying that it was widely shared and discussed within Russia. Who’s speaking up next?
A Republican that everyone likes? Inconceivable.
Arnold is also one of the few accounts followed by…Vladimir Putin.
&gt; To the Russian people protesting ...You are my new heros. You have the strength of Yury Petrovich Vlasov. You have the *true* heart of Russia. ... May god bless you all. 🥲God speed.
u/govschwarzenegger Seems like your message came through.
I worked for Gov. Schwazenegger’s office shortly after I got out of the military, but based out of San Diego. He came down to visit twice while I worked there, and he was exactly the same in person as he comes across in his videos and interviews. Larger than life but completely down to earth. Would have been interesting if we lived in a world where he could have run for president. I probably would have voted for him.
A lot of y'all are going to have strong feelings about this news, but please keep these rules in mind as you comment here:* DO NOT make threats of violence or comments that wish harm on any person, group of people, or institution.* DO NOT describe the ways you'd like to see Ghislaine Maxwell punished, tortured, or killed.

True love is finishing each others sentences, so I guess she must have really loved Jeffrey Epstein.
She was found guilty on 5 of 6 counts. The count she was not convicted of was: "Enticement of an Individual Under the Age of 17 (Jane only) to Travel with Intent to Engage in Illegal Sexual Activity."Not sure the details behind it, but she will likely be going away for the rest of her life.
Count 1: Conspiracy to entice a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts - maximum sentence of **5 years** **GUILTY**Count 2: Enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts - maximum sentence of 5 years **NOT GUILTY**Count 3: Conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity - maximum sentence of **5 years** **GUILTY**Count 4: Transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity - maximum sentence of **10 years** **GUILTY**Count 5: Conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors - maximum sentence of **5 years** **GUILTY**Count 6: Sex trafficking of minors - maximum sentence of **40 years****GUILTY**
I mean, you tell a jury they gotta work through New Year's they're going to give you a verdict, but good job on actually ensuring some accountability for her terrible acts.
So what happens next? Will she talk?
Glad she was found guilty, but she was part of a very big conspiracy and there are still a lot of others who need to be in prison. Let's hope this wasn't just a mop-up job.There are a whole lot of powerful people who were likely implicated in the troves of evidence the feds seized from Epstein. If we don't see high-profile indictments in the coming months or years, hard to say justice was fully served.
Never forget that Maria Farmer went to the FBI in 1996 with the whole case and they did nothing.  In 2004, US Attorney Alex Acosta gave Epstein a sweetheart deal, he later told the Trump Administration vetting team "I was told Epstein belonged to intelligence and to leave it alone."
Hell yes. Now, go after the clients.
Fuck that bitch. Enjoy prison babe!
The judge found him guilty by default because he refused to turn over documents as ordered by the court. God, what an idiot.
This was intentional tort, so that means the victims can be awarded punitive damages. Certain judgements from intentional torts are also not dischargeable in bankruptcy.tl;dr Alex Jones is *screwed,* and is going to be paying out a lot of money. Even if he declares bankruptcy, it may not help.
&gt;Juries will now decide how much Jones has to pay the families in damages and court costs.I hope he financially never recovers from this.
&gt;For years Jones claimed the shooting was a “false flag” operation engineered by the government to bring about stricter gun control laws.  &gt;  &gt;The families of Sandy Hook victims were subjected to years of in-person and online harassment over the claims.  &gt;  &gt;In October, Judge Maya Guerra Gamble ordered a default judgement on Monday against Jones, finding him and his outlet liable for damages after he repeatedly failed to hand over documents for discovery.  &gt;  &gt;Juries will now decide how much Jones has to pay the families in damages and court costs.Good. Fuck that guy. I hope they take all he has and more.
If Hulk Hogan can get $31 million from Gawker over a sex tape then these families deserve 10 times that for the anguish Alex Jones put them through.
*stares out window on this brisk autumn morning, wrapped in a blanket and holding my coffee*“Good”
Sounds like someone is going to be having a sale on Brain Force on his website.
My apologies for being pedantic, but in the US one is not "guilty" or "not guilty" in a civil trial, as these were.  Instead, they are considered "liable" for damages.
I hope this brings even an ounce of peace to those poor families that lost their children they’ll never get back. To lose a child and then be attacked hounded by people calling you a liar is one of the most deplorable social attacks I can ever imagine someone perpetrating on another person. How dare Alex Jones and anyone that ate up his lies about these people. They are just as despicable as he is for their actions. Absolute sub humans bottom feeding off of their cesspool of an “agenda”.  Justice is sweet when it shows up at the right time.
In France there's this great system where if you win a defamation lawsuit against a publication, you can force that publication to display *your message* to their public (following some "equal display" rules where they can't just put your message in some tiny corner no-one sees).I think it's a great way to make the truth win over lies.
Lmao fuck this country
Thomas in his concurring opinion says the court should reconsider Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell — the rulings that now protect contraception, same-sex relationships, and same-sex marriage.In case anyone thought abortion was the end of it.
Abortion tourism, here we come. Just another right for those with money/access, now.
I'm so tired of living through major historical events
It’ll be illegal to have an abortion in about 50 percent of states in a week. Including if you were raped.

The only place with no maternity benefits but we're gonna force you to have your baby.  What a joke of a country.
Thomas just said in his concur to reconsider Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell. What the hell is happening?
Damn dude, imagine being a pregnant 14 year old girl with nowhere to turn. I knew girls that would drink so much to kill the fetus. This is what it’s going to return to.
