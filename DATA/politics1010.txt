He is almost correct
Americans who support Putin can get fucked.
Bob Mueller laid out the charges that Donald Trump obstructed the investigation into Putin’s 2016 attack on the United States. Mitt Romney must demand that Trump be indicted on these charges now
Take out “almost”. And trump is #1 in treason.
I don't think people here understand the word "treason." Romney's statement is pretty strong.
Mitt Romney almost condemns traitors. He is almost brave.
Your votes need to reflect what you say, Romney. Defy your party for the good of your party.
I hope this is the crucible that finally cleanses the GQP'ers and MAGA out of the Republican party, so they can be sane again.
Lol we all laughed at him when he said russia was a huge threat.. take your vcr tape of rocky iv and new coke back to the 80s old man.  Obviously he wasn't a great candidate he had/has alot of bad positions but man we were arrogant
The good news, my dad is switching to voting blue in the mid-terms because of the GOP support for Putin.  Out of all the bullshit Trump has done, this was the final nail.  My dad (75 years old) is old school. Russia will always be the enemy.  My dad is in Florida for the winter talking with the other q-tips.  He said many are talking about voting blue for the midterms.  Especially after I sent him some of Tucker Carlson and Cadence Owens tweets.  The old people are pissed.
Wait, You mean Donald, "We should just get rid of NATO" Trump?
- Trump wanted to dismantle NATO, which would help Putin- Trump wanted to bring Russia back to G7, which would help Putin- Trump withdrew from Open Skies surveillance treaty, which helped Putin
So, he praises Putin and then claims he would have stopped all of this?The same guy who wanted to get rid of NATO and tried to withhold aid to the Ukraine.Yeah, sure.Everything he has done was for the benefit of Russia.He would have certainly not prevented the war and he would have violated the US’ obligations to NATO.
Putin was maneuvering Trump to enact all the measures he needed to make an attack on Ukraine possible.  Trump was either too stupid to see it, or  wholly complicit (which I believe).In many ways, to me, it isn’t surprising that Trump, Fox News, and all the other right wing nut jobs are fully behind Putin. Putin wants a world order where oligarchs are in charge and peasants labor their lives away. He pretty much wants to take the entire world back to the last Russian Tsar’s era.
 He’s right, Russia would have his help and Ukraine would be left completely defenseless.  Traitor Trump is part of Russia’s plan.  How sick is it looking back at what Trump tried to do.  He’s a traitor and should be in jail
“This would’ve never happened if I was president.” Trump.“Putin is going in there as a peacekeeper.” Also Trump.
When a criminal has an inside man in the bank he doesn't need to go in the front door to rob it.
Surprise! He’s still a douchebag!
Hey guys, remember when Mexico paid for that wall? Good times…
Republicans- the party of contradiction, misinformation, lies, gaslighting &amp; irony.
Congress insider trading corrupts our government and their decision making processIf low level corporate employees have to abide by the insider rules then so should Congress. You listening???
Three in four lawmakers think that's cute.
Ban stock trading, ban bribes in the form of campaign donations and set up term limits
And even if they were banned their spouses would just do it instead.
I support allowing lawmakers to only buy index funds. If they believe in the strength of the US economy, why wouldn't index funds be good enough for them?Additionally, while they would be allowed to **buy** index funds, they should be barred from **selling** during their tenure. This would do a couple things:First, it would incentivize Congressional members from doing whatever possible to keep the US economy strong. This means no government shutdowns. Second, it would incentivize them to retire eventually. If they want access to all those index funds that they accumulated over their Congressional career, they would have to retire to earn it. No more octogenarians in Congress.
I think much of our divisions are manufactured by the elites so that they can remain in power. It’s unbelievable that they are still allowed to do this shit.
What I want to know is - why was it ever allowed in the first place?
“It’s a free market and we intend to keep it that way” Yet you’re inside trading you fucking hypocrite. That doesn’t seem free to me. Sorry I just absolutely hate this woman.
Just a reminder that the will of the average American has a statistically non-relevant, near zero impact on public policy. https://www.upworthy.com/amp/20-years-of-data-reveals-that-congress-doesnt-care-what-you-think-2637328701
One in four voters are crooked politicians and lobbyists apparently.
Can she start the process as she a house member?
I thought it was obvious to everyone that conservative justices phrased their comments towards Roe very carefully during their confirmation. As far as I know, none of them ever stated under oath that they wouldn’t overturn it; they only acknowledged it as precedent.I want these motherfuckers excised from the court as soon as possible, but this was by design.
She is correct. It will not mean anything since there is no way they get removed in the senate but the stain of impeachment will stick to them for the rest of history
Lied under oath, lied repeatedly to senators in private meetings, lied to the American public
Clarence Thomas is compromised as well.Alito is just a tool and idiot.Roberts' court is an illegitimate sham and that's how it should be remembered.
I mean not really guys come on.  These justices weren’t stupid when asked questions about whether they’d overturn Roe vs. Wade.  They were perfectly evasive, saying things like “it’s established law” and “it should not be revisited”.  They never explicitly promised, under oath, that they would vote not to overturn Roe vs. Wade.  I want them gone and despise them just like a lot of us here, but these articles saying they lied under oath and need to be impeached based on this are sensationalist.  We need to come after them for sure, but regarding this, there’s unfortunately nothing there.  I wish we could use this energy to go after something more tangible that would actually help our cause.  I feel like we’re now just spinning our wheels and chasing our tails.  But I certainly hope we create real change so that we can undo this damage.
If only there was some branch of government that could check, or balance, the supreme court
Yes.  And without a single second of delay.  Perjury is a crime.
Should also face the 7 years in prison that lying to congress carries.
67 votes in the Senate.

good! conflicts of interest are a poison to good government.
They'll freak out at the very thought, but she's right.
How about getting rid of corporate lobbying while you're at it, and corporate donations to campaigns?
I mean, this shouldn’t even be progressive. This should be a bare minimum requirement.
*and their spouses...
Great. You are supposed to get into the government to help people, not yourself. Good luck that passing either though.
I don't understand how anybody could think being in a position to change laws and regulate industries **wouldn't** be a massive conflict of interest.
Great. Can’t wait to see it not happen.
I can't believe this isn't already a law. This has always baffled me.
Serious, how is this not just plain common sense?
More police protecting him than there were for the kids.
He should just not go. He has nothing to offer these families.
[Greg Abbott once told the people of his state that they weren’t buying enough guns. He said he was embarrassed they weren’t buying enough guns and demanded they all buy more.](https://mobile.twitter.com/gregabbott_tx/status/659427797853536256?lang=en)
OMG....the incivility! Just because your children were murdered by gun violence, doesn't give you the right to get all snippy with me. - Abbott
Yeah, he should have just gone to Cancun with Ted Cruz until things cooled down
Boo at him at every public event; he helped to kill those children.
He's exceptionally tone deaf and greedy as fuck. He doesn't give a shit about these kids. If he did action would have already been taken. Our government can pass laws pretty fucking fast protecting SCOTUS from protesters in front of their homes. Pretty damn fast. If they want something done they could do it. Sad, they don't give a shit about you or your kids or your safety. They only care when it personally effects them. VOTE!
But hey Greg, just like you said - coulda been worse, right? I mean, these people could have had AR15s!
I’m surprised he wasn’t pelted with rotten tomatoes and eggs.
&gt;Despite the criticism against him, polls have found that the governor remains the frontrunner for reelection in November, where many conservative voters continue opposing stricter gun laws.This tells you *everything* you need to know. Conservatives value their hobby over their children
People are angry. They want Democrats to be angry and to act angry. They don’t want them act like they are that violin group playing songs while the Titanic sinks.
Pretty sure mixing God and America is the issue here
Not all of them. https://twitter.com/DrewHLive/status/1540359953914937349
They should have just taken turns singing "Imagine"
Christian nationalists are taking over every aspect of our lives and the only thing standing between them and victory are these people. We are so boned
Looks like they got the pictures of uvalde victims there. I guess it was a photo op for the bill they passed last night. I mean good job on the bill but have some common sense to not do this now when the protest are happening right behind you! Just so cringey 😬
I refuse to celebrate the birth of a country that denies me equal protection just because I don’t have a penis.
What a depressingly perfect metaphor for how this country is run. Conservatives inside stripping away rights and the Democrats are outside singing a fucking song.
What a weird decision! Why do this!
The SCOTUS makes a clearly religious decision that your party disagrees with and you sing ***GOD BLESS*** America. Way to make the argument for separation of church and state
Cue a herd of rednecks in trailers complaining about high taxes on the rich.
You could make $5,000 a day for 500 years and if you saved every penny you still wouldn't have a billion dollars. It's about time they started taxing the rich. I don't care of billionaires exist if poverty has been eliminated but that's not what has happened, poverty is increasing.
Checks Senate roster..... not happening.
Well now, that sounds progressive.
Everyone seems to be missing this line:&gt;As a result, this new minimum tax will eliminate the ability for the unrealized income of ultra-high-net-worth households to go untaxed for decades or generations,Taxing "unrealized income" is a radical departure from existing tax policy, not just a "minimum tax".Whether that's good or not will of course depend on people's political preferences and levels of economic understanding... but the whole article seems to be worded to obfuscate this.
Nb4 the working class conservatives have a melt down over something that would benefit them.

A lot of replies appear confused by the difference between the marginal rate and the proposed minimum amount.
[deleted]
It should be higher than 67%
I don't think it matters what Americans want, the people abusing their power are the ones who decide this. Correct?
Unfortunately public support for policies has little to nothing to do with what gets passed.
33% of Americans hope that one day they can become corrupt politicians.
Only 5% support stock trading by Congress, Only 1 in 20...this 67% number is a distraction that makes it sound like there is a debate.
This is like Congress voting on a bill to remove their ability to raise their own salaries... never gonna happen
I'm sorry, but if $174k a year isn't enough for these greedy fuckheads, I'll do the job for half the price and not trade stocks.
Interesting and very normal how this is put at Pelosi's feet and not the majority of Congress.
Who the hell doesn’t support this?!?
Apparently NFL players aren't allowed to bet on games. But congress can trade stocks with inside trader knowledge... Makes sense.
&gt;Activist Chaz Stevens has filed a complaint with eight school districts in Florida challenging the Bible’s place in schools after Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) and GOP state legislators passed a “Stop WOKE Act” meant to keep “prohibited topics” like racism and LGBTQ issues out of the classroom.  Stevens cites examples directly from the tome to prove that the Bible is too “woke” to be available to young students.  &gt;  &gt;\[...\]Stevens, an atheist, is turning the tables on Bible-beating conservatives who touted the law. Listing multiple examples of “prohibited content,” Stevens backed up his assertions with chapter and verse.  “With the constant concerns about teaching Critical Race Theory, should we not take stock of the Bible’s position on slavery? I am concerned our young white students will read such passages and wake up to civilization’s sordid past,” he wrote in his complaint.
This is what we need more of really. Take matters into your own hands and start opposing these bills with actions like this. You have to counter the organized conservative side with organized action too.
Jesus was a lot more woke than conservatives are willing to acknowledge.
I hear it’s full of socialist ideas like healing the sick and feeding the hungry.
It's not even malicious compliance. It's just compliance.
“The state Board of Education announced last week that it will reject 71% of elementary school math textbooks and 41% of textbooks for all grades.”  [71% of math books].  Florida GOP is hoping citizens don’t, or can’t, put 2 and 2 together that they’re nuts.
Doesn't the Bible feature a story about two chicks getting their own father drunk so they could rape him and get pregnant? I've seen more wholesome content on Pornhub, for fuck sake!
The Don’t Say Gay law is going to bite conservatives pretty hard. It’s pretty easy to turn it around from the narrow intent and make it an instrument of wokeness.
Yep. Can concur. Would not feel safe letting my children read this, nor attend a certain church which seems to groom their young children for pedophilia
As a member of the Binarian religion, I take offense to any math book that teaches my kids about any numbers other than 0 and 1. These are the only true numbers, and all others are heretical.
