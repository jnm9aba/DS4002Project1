### Installing/Building Code

The code is in the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file format). It can be run locally using software such as Jupyter Labs or VSCode, or in the cloud using a service such as 
Google Colab.

### Usage of Code

The code requires the following Python libraries: pandas, requests, and vaderSentiment. These libraries must be installed locally for the code to run. This can be done
in Jupyter Notebook with the following command: !pip install [package_name]. To connect to the Reddit API certain credentials are required which are provided in the 
Jupyter Notebook file. The best practice would be to require a seperate config file for security, however we believe given the scope of this project providing the
credentials directly in the file is appropriate. The file will prompt the user for which subreddit they want to access and what types of posts they want to see. There
are options to download the data as a csv, to download the corresponding comments as a text file, and to print the results of the sentiment analysis.
